# Digital Futures workshop 2020: Heirarchy in Geometric order and Agent Behavior
Workshop to grasp an understanding of hierarchical nature of geometric orders in architecture in different styles such as classical, art deco and discrete, and also in nature through computational design exercises with agents who have hierarchical temporal behaviors.

Taught by : Satoru Sugihara, founder ATLV Computational Design Studio
