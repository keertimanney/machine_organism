# Post Anthropocene Living Machine ( Generative iterations )
- Bottom up approach 
- Explore various agent behaviors and growth aesthetics to form functional parts of the living machine
- Generate using the clock agent algorithm to create more complexities and hierarchy
- Organic hierarchical patterns overlaid on machine parts 
- Complex branching and Network growth systems
- Machine aesthetics with organic growth
